# tabletop-simulater-types
Typescript definitions for making code that can be transpiled to Tabletop Simulator's Lua Implementation

This is a work in progress.

If you want some part of the api to be included that I have not written the types for please submit an issue ticket and I will try to get to it asap. You can also find @ me in the typescript-to-lua discord with the same username as here. Please feel free to at me your issue link. (PS I am really busy so making the issue and then taging me with the link to it in discord is the most reliable way to get my attention for it)

I am defining the types as I need them so I don't go crazy doing them all at once.
